Thwaite
=======
Missiles are falling from the sky. Shoot them down with your fireworks.

Requirements
------------
Thwaite is designed for Nintendo Entertainment System.  It works on
a [PowerPak], an NROM cartridge board, or popular NES emulators.
It attempts to adapt the game and music speed to NTSC or PAL NES
at runtime.  It can be played with the standard NES controller or a
Super NES Mouse connected to a Super NES controller to NES adapter
or an FC Twin famiclone.

Building from source requires GNU Make, GNU Coreutils, Python 3,
Pillow, and ca65. For detailed instructions to bring up a build
environment, see [nrom-template].

Thwaite makes explosions and smoke appear translucent by flickering
them. A very small percentage of people have [seizures] after looking
at flickering patterns in television and video games. If you have had
convulsions or loss of awareness of surroundings, see a health care
professional before playing any video game.

Intense video games can be tiring and cause [Nintendo thumb], a form
of repetitive strain injury. Take a five-minute break at least every
half hour or so, and don't play when you need sleep.
